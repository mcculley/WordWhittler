# WordWhittler

WordWhittler is a writing assistant.

It leverages [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org) and [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu) (via [extJWNL](https://extjwnl.sourceforge.net) to provide you with hints and suggestions on how to improve your writing. When composing text, the word under your cursor is looked up, providing synomymns and other related words at a glance.

WordWhittler is open source. Source code is available at [https://github.com/mcculley/WordWhittler](https://github.com/mcculley/WordWhittler).

WARNING: This is a work in progress and a way for me to tinker with writing ideas. If it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces.
